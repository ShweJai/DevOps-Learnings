What is Linux?
Linux is an operating system (OS) 🖥️. Just like Windows or macOS 🍏, it’s software that manages your computer’s hardware and software resources. It's the environment in which you run applications and programs 🛠️.
The key things to know about Linux are:
•	Open Source 🔓: Linux is free to use, and its source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This is a huge part of what makes Linux unique compared to other operating systems like Windows or macOS, which are proprietary (closed source) 🏢.
•	Kernel 🐧: The core part of Linux is called the kernel. The kernel is responsible for communicating with the hardware of your computer and managing system resources like memory 🧠, processing power ⚡, and input/output devices ⌨️. The Linux kernel is the foundation of the entire operating system.
•	Distributions 📦: Linux comes in different versions called distributions. Some of the most popular ones are Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS. These are all based on the Linux kernel but might have different interfaces, tools, and applications pre-installed. Some distros are easier to use for beginners (like Ubuntu), while others are meant for advanced users (like Arch Linux).
•	Command-Line Interface (CLI) vs. Graphical User Interface (GUI) 🖱️ vs. ⌨️: On Linux, you can interact with the system in two main ways:
o	CLI (Command-Line Interface): This is where you type commands into a terminal 🖥️ (a text-based interface) to control the system.
o	GUI (Graphical User Interface): This is a more user-friendly, visual interface where you can click on icons and use menus 📂 (like what you're used to with Windows or macOS).
Why use Linux? 🤔
•	Security 🔐: Linux is known for being secure. Because it's open-source, there are many people constantly reviewing and improving the system, which reduces vulnerabilities.
•	Free 💸: Unlike Windows or macOS, you don’t need to pay to use Linux. It’s completely free, which is appealing to many users.
•	Community 👥: Since it’s open-source, there’s a huge online community of users and developers who contribute to Linux and help each other out.
